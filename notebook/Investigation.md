# Investigation
Initial work was focussed on discovering how the datasets work & creating tools to help us during the challenge (automatic notebook being a key for us to make sure that we stay organised).

Tools:
- Google Earth Pro (data visualisation)
- Visual Studio Code (IDE)
- NC Viewer (.nc file viewer)
- GitHub (source control)
