# Initial Research

Types of tropospheric propagtion:

## Enhanced Tropospheric Refraction (50MHz to 432MHz)

- Occurs when there is a significant increase above the normal value of refractive index in the atmosphere e.g. when the lower troposphere divides into 2 stable layers, warm dry air over cool moist air.
- Boundary between the layers is called inversion
- Temp decreases with height and humidity increases with height
- Signals 'bend' (refract) when they cross the inversion

## Tropospheric Ducting (144MHz to 432 MHz)
- Occurs when radio waves are trapped within channels bounded by sharp changes in refractive index surface ducts 
- Signals get trapped in the surface layer (between ground and inversion) as the refractive bending increases so much that the signal hits the ground far away from the TX, then reflects back to inversion, hence 'trapped'. 
- Occurs when a steep negative gradient in R.I. forms  immediately above the ground elevated ducts 
- Form when there is a double discontinuity in R.I., upper temp inversion and lower temp. waves reflected upwards by the lower boundary of duct and down by upper boundary. Waves guided over irregular terrain until broken by mountains
        
## Tropospheric Scattering (50MHz to 432MHz)
Arises from small-scale variations in the refractive index brings in distant fluttery signals from beyond normal line of sight. Changes in R.I. occur when there is turbulence, e.g. in convection cells or strong wind.

Caused by high levels of water vapour and air density... 

## Air density 
- mass of air per unit volume in lower troposphere, differences in water vapour content dominate R.I. changes in higher, temp variations are dominant factor, and changes in R.I. decreases, 

refractive index decreases with height... exponential equation? 
Refractive index depends on air temp and dew point
Temp, pressure and water vapour is different everywhere :/

Day ground is hot, evening ground cools. ducts develop progressively through lifetime of an anticyclone so biggest openings occur after several days of enhanced propagation
