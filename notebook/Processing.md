# Signal processing
This is where we ran out of time. Running the scripts you can see that we managed to extract the datasets and map them using matplotlib. However, when it came to actually manipulating the data in any meaningful way we struggled to get much further.

We have investigated various papers and theories for data processing (mostly time averaging) but applying these principles a) in a language we did not know and b) a dataset we were not very familiar with proved extremely difficult. We have provided some papers below that we've found interesting, and also visited this some more in our presentation.
