!!There are two major types of errors; errors caused by nonuniform water vapor distribution in the vertical direction and   those caused by nonuniform water-vapor distribution in the horizontal direction.

The errors caused by water vapor distribution in the vertical direction show a pattern similar to that of topography. This is because the difference in the water-vapor appears as much as thickness of the atmosphere is different by the topography such as mountains or valleys when taking the difference between observations at distinct times when the water vapor is different. These errors can be removed to a certain degree using the correlation with altitude.

On the other hand, the errors caused by nonuniform water vapor distribution in the horizontal direction are generated randomly by local weather phenomena and are difficult to remove.

Because of the errors caused by the condition of water vapor distribution in the horizontal direction, the errors caused by the condition of water vapor distribution in the vertical direction may not be sufficiently corrected. In such cases, interferograms obtained at different times are compared or the mean value is obtained.

As to the errors caused by the condition of water-vapor distribution in the horizontal direction, the larger the spatial scale, the larger the amplitude becomes. Therefore, a difference of 10 cm at points 50 km apart is possible, whereas a difference of 10 cm at points several kilometers apart is unlikely.!!
